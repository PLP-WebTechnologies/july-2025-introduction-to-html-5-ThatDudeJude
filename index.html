        <h2>Cat Poem</h2>
        <p>Here is a cool cat poem you can share with your feline friends.</p>

        <h3>üêæ **The Cat in the Hat (Not That One!)** üò∏</h3>            

            <p>There once was a cat with a very big hat,<br>
            He sat on the couch and squashed it flat!<br>
            He stretched with a yawn, then blinked one eye,<br>
            And watched a bird as it flew by.</p>

            <p>He chased his tail in dizzy spins,<br>
            Then pounced on socks and clothespins.<br>
            He leapt up high, then flopped down low,<br>
            Then vanished quick‚Äîwhere did he go?</p>

            <p>Behind the curtain! Under the bed!<br>
            With just two glowing eyes instead!<br>
            He popped back out with a mighty meow,<br>
            Demanding food, "I‚Äôm hungry now!"</p>

            <p>He purred and purred with all his might,<br>
            Curled in a ball and slept all night.<br>
            So if you see a hat too wide,<br>
            A cat might just be curled inside!</p>
